    Hello World.<br>
    
    The difficulties attending a plan for the instruction of the negroe slaves in our colonies are very different from the obstacles which present themselves to the conversion of North American Indians. The quick sagacity of the Indian keeps him aloof from every attempt to convert him. The dull stupidity of the Negroe leaves him without any desire for instruction. Whether the Creator originally formed these Black People a little lower than other men, or that they have lost their intellectual powers through disuse, I will not assume the province of determining; but certain it is that the <i>new Negroe</i> (as those lately imported from Africa are called) is a complete definition of indolent stupidity, nor could a more forceful means be employed for the conversion of a deist, than setting one of these creatures before him, as an example of a man in a state of nature, unbiased by revelation or education. Their stupidity does not however authorize us to consider beasts for our use, much less to deny them all use of the common salvation. The Negroes born in our colonies are undoubtedly capable of recieving instruction, and those who are born among the French are instructed in the Roman Catholic religion; but our planters are averse to our Negroes being taught anything but labour, and yet the generality of our North American planters have a regard for religion, and are punctual in the discharge of its duties, as far as they think themselves obliged by them. How this comes to past must be our first inquiry; for unless the planter can be prevailed upon to provide his assistance, it will be in vain to propose any method for instructing his slaves.<br>
